# What is a shell?

A Shell enables CloudShell users to interact with different sandbox elements, like physical devices and virtual appliances. A Shell models the sandbox element in CloudShell and provides commands that CloudShell users and automation processes can run on it, like Power On and Health Check. Each 2nd Gen Shell is modeled after a CloudShell standard, from which the shell inherits its default settings, attributes and driver.

On the Quali Community portal: https://community.quali.com/ , you can find both officially released shells and shells developed in the developer community. If you find a shell that fits your needs, you can use it as is, or, you can customize its settings and automatio. If you can’t find the shell you’re looking for, you can create a new one from scratch using one of the shell standard templates available and contribute it to the community for others to use it as well.

Historically, Quali has had two types of shells in CloudShell, 1st Generation shells and 2nd Generation shells. While 1st Gen shells are still used, all new shells are released only as 2nd Generation shells and this developer guide focuses on this type of shells.
