# Controller VM

The Controller VM allows you to configure virtual network adapters on individual VMs, and store and distribute virtual network policies. With this feature, you can create virtual networks and subnets, attach virtual machines (VMs) to these networks, and enable communication between VMs in the same virtual network.
